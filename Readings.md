We are working from mainly two texts:
1. Practical Applied Mathematics by Sam Howison
2. Mathematical Models in the Applied Sciences by A.C. Fowler

Both are available online, for free or for payment. 

For our first week of lecture, we covered material in the following chapters, which I strongly suggest you read. (In addition to reading the Jupyter notebooks for the course.

Howison chapters:
**1.** The basics of modelling
**2.** Units, dimenstion and dimensional analysis
**3.** Nondimensionalization
**12.** Asymptotics

Fowler chpaters:
**1.** Mathematical modeling
**2.** Nondimensional analysis
**3.** Asymptotics

For your term project, you should browse through the other chapters in the books to see some typical examples of math applied to some real physican or industrial problems. Try to pick out 2 or 3 that you really find interesting, and read in depth. 
- Fowler - anything labeled "Case Study." E.g. Chapters 4,5,6,8,11, etc
- Fowler, Chapter 15 on piano tuning is one we did in class.
- Howison - Chapters 5-16 on Classical Models
- Howison - Chapters 17-20. Advanced models.
