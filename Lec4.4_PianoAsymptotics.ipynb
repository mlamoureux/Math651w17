    "# Piano Asymptotics\n",
    "\n",
    "As an exercise in class, let's explore the piano wire approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall treating the wire as an elastic beam, we get a 4th order ODE describing the motion. This changes the pattern of the harmonics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to explore:\n",
    "- can we hear the difference?\n",
    "- can we hear beats in harmonics, between fundamentals and 1st harmonics?\n",
    "- can we plot anything interesting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to do\n",
    "- how do we produce sounds in Jupyter?\n",
    "- how can we vary a small parameter in a systematics way\n",
    "- how do we sum series?\n",
    "- how do we play with weights in the summation series\n",
    "- can we see this in the Fourier transform?\n",
    "- Wavelets? Gabor? Other time-freq transforms?\n",
    "\n",
    "Warnings\n",
    "- what about clipping of the waveform (what is this)\n",
    "- what about the quality of sound from our little laptop\n",
    "- do we trust our ears, or our Fourier transform>\n"
