    "A fusion reactor is a controlled nuclear fusion device, used to fuse light atoms into heavier atoms (e.g. hydrogen fused into helium), producing heat that can be used to power an electric generator. Fusion is of course the source of energy in our Sun. \n",
    "\n",
    "On earth, nuclear fusion has been achieved through the use of hydrogen bombs, which are actually initiated by atomic bombs (using nuclear fission of uranium or plutonium atoms). A bomb is an inconvenient source of energy, so people are interested in created controlled fusion to generate useful power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Current technology rely on tokomaks (toroidal-shaped magnetic bottles) or intense laser beams to force a plasma of hydrogen to fuse into helium. They have not yet reached the break-even point, where more energy is produced than what is consumed in initiating the reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "A company in B.C., named General Fusion, is attempted a method where physical pistons are used to compress a metal ball containing the plasma of hydrogen atoms. It is a novel idea, heavily funded, but also not yet able to achieve effective fusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of a mathematical modeling problem, we will look at a report by Michael Lindstrom, published in SIAM's Journal of Applied Math, which gives an interesting asymptotic analysis of the General Fusion approach. The reference is below. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good example of how to approach the applied mathematical modeling problem in a real industrial setting. \n",
