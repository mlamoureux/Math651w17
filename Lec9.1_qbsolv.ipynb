Only one bit can be equal to one, so assign a penalty if more than one bit at a vectex is non-zero. (Also assign a penalty if that are all zero.)

Also, not all qubits can interact with any other qubit -- there is a limitation to which ones pairwise interact. This means only some of the off-diagonal entries in $Q$ can be non-zero. Moreover, there is limited precision on how accurately the value for each $Q_{ij}$ can be set -- it depends a lot on the physics of the real system they have constructed. \n",
